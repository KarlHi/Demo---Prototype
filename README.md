# Project-Prototype
 Pattern Repetition Tracking System with Accelerometer for Warehouse Employees by MovErgonomics

This project was craeted 2022 by a group of KTH students in the courses HL2032/HE1040/HL2041 with the purpose of automating the ergonomic assessment process of movements. To be used for workers (warehouse etc) but also with the possibility to addapt into gym training. For more information read our short paper.
This code is the demo / prototype verson. 


The code is written in C and compiled / build with a platformIO and drivers created by Linus Remhl. 
The needed hardware components is a GD32v103 RISC-V microcontroller, a MPU-6500 IMU connected through I2C, a LED or DC-motor connected through PWM, a Button and SD-Card connected through GPIO.
